## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. Node.js 18+ installed (for local testing)
2. Git repository set up
3. All environment variables required by the application
4. Run a production build locally to verify it works: `npm run build`

## Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

### Core Web Vitals Optimization

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: 
  - Critical images are preloaded using the `CriticalImage` component
  - Font display optimization with `swap` strategy
  - Resource preloading with `ResourcePreloadManager`

- **FID (First Input Delay)**:
  - JavaScript execution optimization
  - Deferred loading of non-critical scripts
  - Code splitting and dynamic imports

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**:
  - Fixed image dimensions
  - Optimized font loading
  - Content placeholders during loading

- **Additional Optimizations**:
  - Responsive image optimization
  - CSS minification with PurgeCSS and CSSNano
  - JavaScript tree-shaking

### SEO Enhancements

- Comprehensive metadata implementation
- Structured data (schema.org) integration
- XML sitemaps with specialized versions for images and news
- Optimized robots.txt configuration

## Deployment Options

### Vercel Deployment

Vercel is the recommended deployment platform for this Next.js application.

1. **Connect your repository**:
   ```bash
   npx vercel link
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.production` file with required variables, then:
   ```bash
   npx vercel env pull
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify configuration**:
   Ensure the Vercel project uses the settings from `vercel.json`, including:
   - Optimized caching strategies
   - Security headers
   - Image optimization
   - Edge functions (if applicable)

### Netlify Deployment

1. **Connect your repository** to Netlify

2. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Set environment variables in the Netlify dashboard

3. **Enable Netlify plugins**:
   The `netlify.toml` file includes configurations for:
   - Next.js plugin
   - Sitemap submission
   - Critical CSS inlining
   - Cache optimization

### Render Deployment

1. **Create a new Web Service** on Render dashboard

2. **Connect your repository**

3. **Configure the service**:
   - Type: Web Service
   - Environment: Node
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`

4. **Set environment variables** in the Render dashboard

5. **Advanced Configuration**:
   The `render.yaml` file includes:
   - Auto-scaling rules
   - Custom headers for performance
   - Memory and CPU allocation

### Self-Hosted Deployment

For self-hosted environments:

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Nginx Configuration** (recommended):
   ```nginx
   server {
     listen 80;
     server_name flashcryptosenders.com;

     location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
     }

     # Caching static assets
     location /_next/static/ {
       alias /path/to/.next/static/;
       expires 1y;
       add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
     }

     # Caching images
     location /images/ {
       alias /path/to/public/images/;
       expires 1y;
       add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
     }
   }
   ```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. **Performance metrics**:
   - Run Lighthouse tests on deployed site
   - Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
   - Verify with WebPageTest.org

2. **Functionality verification**:
   - Test all critical user flows
   - Verify responsive design on different devices
   - Check for console errors

3. **SEO verification**:
   - Test structured data with Google's Structured Data Testing Tool
   - Verify sitemap is accessible
   - Check robots.txt configuration

## Monitoring and Analytics

The application includes built-in monitoring:

1. **Performance monitoring**:
   - Web Vitals tracking via `/api/cron/performance-monitor` endpoint
   - Integration with analytics platforms

2. **Error tracking**:
   - Centralized error logging
   - Real-time monitoring

3. **User analytics**:
   - Integration with Matomo/Plausible/SimpleAnalytics
   - Conversion tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Build failures**:
   - Check for compatibility issues with dependencies
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check for syntax errors in configuration files

2. **Performance issues**:
   - Review server-side rendering strategy
   - Check for blocking resources
   - Optimize image delivery

3. **Caching issues**:
   - Verify cache headers are correctly set
   - Test cache invalidation

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security best practices:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Strict CSP rules in headers
   - Frame protection

2. **HTTPS enforcement**:
   - HSTS configuration
   - Automatic HTTPS redirection

3. **Protection headers**:
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection
   - Frame protection
